What is Docker?

Docker is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. 
A developer defines all the applications and itâ€™s dependencies in a Dockerfile which is then used to build Docker images that defines a Docker container. 
Doing this ensures that your application will run in any environment.
